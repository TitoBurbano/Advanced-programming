# Project Definition

The project consists of the development of monolithic software for a music streaming website. In terms of technical decisions, the project was limited to the processes of streaming music, creating and managing playlists.
It is a business model focused on providing streaming music services to users over the Internet.
As for the interested parties, we consider that the main interested parties in software with these characteristics are the artists who would publish their music on the site for the reach of many people and all the users who will benefit from being able to play music online.
Now, among the tools necessary to develop this software, and taking into account that it will be a monolith, it was decided to use Python for the development of the backend together with the FastAPI framework. For the graphical interface it was decided to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the Django framework. Finally, PostgreSQL will be used for the database, due to its reputation for reliability and scalability in production environments.
